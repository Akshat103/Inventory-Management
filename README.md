## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The inventory management system is a web-based project built using the MERN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The front-end is built using Chakra UI, which provides a sleek and modern user interface. The system is designed to manage inventory by multiple users in a secure and efficient manner.

The inventory management system has a number of features that make it an effective tool for managing inventory. Firstly, multiple users can access the system simultaneously, which means that multiple team members can work on inventory management tasks at the same time. This helps to streamline the process and improves overall efficiency.

The system allows users to add, update and delete products from the inventory. Users can add new products to the inventory by specifying the product name, description, category, quantity, and price. They can also update existing products by changing any of these attributes. Furthermore, they can delete products from the inventory if they are no longer needed.

The inventory management system has a user authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. Users must sign up for an account, and then log in using their username and password. This ensures that sensitive inventory data is protected from unauthorized access.

The system also has a search functionality, which allows users to search for products by name or category. This makes it easy to find specific products in a large inventory. Additionally, the system provides users with detailed reports on inventory levels, which helps them make informed decisions about restocking products.

In conclusion, the inventory management system is a robust and efficient tool for managing inventory by multiple users. With its user-friendly interface, powerful features, and robust security, it can help streamline inventory management tasks and improve overall efficiency.
